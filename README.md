# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe is a strategy game played between two players. It is typically played on a 3x3 square grid. One player uses the symbol "X" while the other player uses the symbol "O".

Players take turns placing their symbols in empty squares. The objective is to create a sequence of three of their own symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to place three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all the squares are filled and neither player has achieved a winning sequence, the game ends in a draw.

Tic Tac Toe is a popular game played by children and adults due to its simple rules and limited strategic options. It can also be played on computer games or applications.
